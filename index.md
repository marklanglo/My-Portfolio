## Welcome to my Portfolio

Hello, I am **Mark Wiedeman**, and this is a simple website to archive some of my git repos containing past projects.  I've chosen these projects to best represent me and how I write code.  As for the projects here: The **Tic-Tac-Toe** is a demonstration of my function use and algorithms, the **Tom and Jerry** project shows my ability to navigate graphical components of Java, and then the **Solar System** project is simply for fun.  **Feel free to visit any of the git repos from this page as they each have git repos with pages which more greatly describe and show the programs.**

### Tic-Tac-Toe

   This is one of my earlier programs, it offers a few simple functions such as single player, two player, and switching the names of the players via the console.  Playing the game itself is also relatively simple as it is done by entering the space you would like the 'X' or 'O' to go respectively, depending on which player you are. 
   The single player uses an AI based on the minimax algorithm.  Throughout the program there are many prompts and descriptions for how it is meant to work in order to guide the player through the console based environment.  Basic ASCII art is used for winnning and losing screens as well.

### Tom and Jerry

   This is a java graphical program that has two dots moving across the screen, the brownish dot is Jerry(Mouse) and the Greyish dot is Tom(Cat).  The user inputs the speed that both will move at, and then they enter the angle at which Jerry will bounce off the walls.  The program is essentially one dot that bounces off of the walls and the other pathfinds to the ball that is bouncing around until it catches it.
   For coding style, this program demostrates how extensive I can be when it comes to commenting.  Reading through the comments on this project would grant a deep understanding of what the code is doing where.

### Solar System

   This is a more recent program which is simply a demonstration of basic java graphics.  The program calculates the rate at which earth, mars, and the moon are meant to spin based on the inputted speed by the user.  This is simply an extra program for fun.
